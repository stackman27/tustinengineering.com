        Sishir Giri, a sophomore T-Tech student, developed an app for the Congressional App Challenge

        (CAC), winning 3rd place for California’s 45th congressional district, currently represented

        by Republican Mimi Walters. The district includes the communities of Irvine, Tustin, North

        Tustin, Villa Park, Orange, Anaheim Hills, Laguna Hills, Lake Forest, Rancho Santa

        Margarita and Mission Viejo. The CAC is a competition aimed at encouraging U.S. high school

        students to learn how to code by creating their own applications. The Challenge is intended to

        highlight the value of computer science and STEM education and encourage students to engage

        in these fields. By encouraging and recognizing our nation’s young programming talent,

        Congress hopes to shine a light on the growing importance of these skills. Sishir’s app

        “Caucus” allows teachers and students to interact with each other in a friendly and easy

        question/answer format. He is also the designer of T-Tech’s new website:

      <p> Hi Folks, <br> <br>

        Angelica Verde, one of our 2016 Boeing interns, was the only high school student featured in the Orange County Career Pathways Showcase this past Wednesday at the Marconi Museum.  She was on stage in front of a who's-who of Orange County dignitaries to interview the Vice President of Virgin Galactic.  She was awesome.
        The film crew from the Orange County Dept. of Ed put together a <a href = "https://vimeo.com/190758656/ef4ea1cf3a" > great video of her which you can see here. </a>  <br> <br>  It will also be posted in the <a href = "../Videos/Video.html#intro"> Video section </a>  of our new T-Tech website.
        <br> You can also read about her in the <a href = "https://edsource.org/2016/growth-of-career-programs-emphasizing-hands-on-learning-offering-students-new-opportunities/573590"> accompanying article from Edsource. </a>

        T-Tech students Derek Weaver, Angelica Verde, Eric Baker and Brandon Rossano build a mechanical arm under the direction of teacher Ed Hernandez. The mechanical arm provides Nick an oppourtunity to practice operation a prosthetic limb before he becomes a less flexible adult.
        Nick's desire to play tennis is well enhanced with the prosthetic arm as he is now able to toss the ball with his left hand and swing with his right hand.
