      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p>The T-Tech Academy of Technology & Engineering is Tustin High School's award winning STEM program now entering its sixth year as a CPA academy. <br> <br>  Having grown from 25 students six years ago to over 250 today, T-Tech has become a model for STEM education Traditionally, there has always been a lot of <i> Science </i> and <i> Math </i>
        in school, but not much <i> Technology </i> or <i> Engineering </i>. By combining academic instruction with cutting edge project based learning, our students gain an edge not found in the traditional educational model. In addition its UC-approved courses in all four grade levels, T-Tech students are involved in a number of extracurricular activities
        and competitions such as the OC Maker Challenge and UC Irvine's Energy Invitational where T-Tech has consistently placed at the top. <br> <br>Every year, T-Tech juniors also get the chance to apply for the prestigious Boeing Summer Internship, an opportunity only available to Tustin High students and 12 other schools in Orange County. Through
        a new partnership with UPS, graduating seniors also have the opportunity to intern at United Parcel Service's engineering department. <br> <br> To date, 50% of all graduating T-Tech seniors have gone on to major in STEM fields at 4-yr universities. After only three graduating classes, T-Tech's alumni are majoring in STEM related fields at some of
        the country's top universities including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCI, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, Michigan State, Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Pomona and many more. <br> <br> Tustin High School's T-Tech Academy of Technology and Engineering has been named Orange County's STEM program of the year, and is a proud recipient of the 2015 Golden Bell Award, recognizing
        T-Tech as one of the best Career Technical Education programs in the state. In 2016, T-Tech was also selected as one of the only 15 high school in the United States to take part in the prestigious Lemelson MIT Foundation's InvenTeams program in Cambridge, Massachusetts. T-Tech is led by Mr Ed Hernandez, an Electrical Engineering graduate from UC Irvine
        and California's 2015 CTE Teacher of the Year.</p>
